LightGBM:
LightGBM works by iteratively building decision trees while minimizing the gradient of the loss function to make accurate predictions for the target variable.

KNN:
KNN (k-nearest neighbors) algorithm works by finding the class of a data point based on the classes of its nearest neighbors in the feature space.

Decision Tree:
The decision tree algorithm works by recursively partitioning the data based on the features to create a tree-like structure, enabling it to make decisions or predictions for new data points.

SVM:
The SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates different classes in the data, maximizing the margin between the classes and allowing it to classify new data points effectively.

Logistic Regression:
The logistic regression algorithm works by fitting a logistic function to the input data, which maps the input features to the probability of belonging to a specific binary outcome class, allowing it to perform binary classification.

Naive Bayes:
The Naive Bayes algorithm works by using Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of a data point belonging to a specific class given its features, assuming that the features are conditionally independent, and then selecting the class with the highest probability as the predicted class for the data point.
