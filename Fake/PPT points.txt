Abstract
Fake bank currency poses a significant threat to our country's financial system. During demonetization, a large amount of counterfeit money was found in circulation.
Distinguishing fake notes from genuine ones is challenging due to their similarity. An automated system using machine learning can aid in identifying forged bank currency efficiently.
Six supervised machine learning algorithms can be used for banknote authentication.
The algorithms employed are: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes.
Additionally, the LightGBM algorithm is also used.

Introduction
In our fast-paced financial world, banknotes play a critical role as a valuable asset of our country.
However, counterfeit notes are being introduced into the market, closely resembling genuine ones, causing financial discrepancies.
Human detection of forged bank currency is difficult due to the high precision with which fraudsters create fake notes.
Government-designed features on banknotes help identify genuine ones, but counterfeiters mimic these features with great accuracy.
To combat this problem, an automated system using machine learning can be implemented in banks and ATMs.
The goal is to design an automated system to determine the legitimacy of banknotes.
By inputting the physical features of the banknote and applying various machine learning techniques, relevant features are extracted.
These features are then fed into SML algorithms to predict whether the note is genuine or fake.

problem statement
Developing an automated system using machine learning to detect counterfeit banknotes from genuine ones, addressing the rising concern of fake currency in the financial market.

Aim
Create an automated system to combat the rising prevalence of counterfeit banknotes in the financial market.
Leverage machine learning algorithms to accurately identify forged banknotes based on their distinctive features.
Safeguard the economy by ensuring the authenticity of monetary transactions and protecting businesses and individuals from financial losses due to counterfeit currency.

Existing System
Supervised machine learning (SML) is widely used for classification problems, showing promising results in medical disease detection.
Limited research has been done applying SML algorithms to bank currency authentication.
To detect genuine or fake banknotes, an automated system is necessary.
The system takes an image of the banknote as input and extracts features using image processing techniques.
SML algorithms are then employed to predict whether the note is authentic or counterfeit.
Notably, there is a gap in the research on this subject, indicating an opportunity for further exploration and development.

Proposed system
The proposed system utilized several popular algorithms, including KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes.
Additionally, the LightGBM algorithm was introduced as an extension to the existing set of algorithms.
The performance of LightGBM was compared against the other algorithms used in the study.
This comparison aimed to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of LightGBM for bank currency authentication.
The inclusion of LightGBM expands the scope of the research and allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of different machine learning approaches.

Feasibility study
 Operational Feasibility
The proposed system should seamlessly integrate with existing bank and ATM operations.
Adequate resources, technical expertise, and support must be available for implementation and maintenance.
End-users, such as bank staff and customers, should be willing to adopt and utilize the system effectively.
The system should comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
Scalability and future growth considerations should be taken into account for sustained performance.
Technical Feasibility
The purpose of this study is to assess the technical feasibility of the system.
The system must not impose a high demand on the available technical resources.
High demands on the technical resources may lead to an excessive burden on the client.
The developed system should have modest resource requirements, necessitating minimal or no changes for implementation.
 Economic Feasibility
The purpose of this study is to assess the economic impact of the system on the organization.
This project is developed with a limited budget for research and development of the system, so expenditures must be justified.
The developed system is within the allocated budget, primarily due to the utilization of freely available technologies.
